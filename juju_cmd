juju init # init config
juju switch local # switch to local instead of amazon deploy
sudo bootstrap --series=precise,raring --upload-tools=true # prepare env (local etc)
# precise is useful for haproxy, raring is deprecated but used for the rest
# supposed OSCIED is already installed (following official guide)
OSCIED/scripts/menu.sh deploy # pick: Local (to deploy, separately from juju)
# no to terminate (already done)
# y for transform (1 instance)
# y for publisher (1 instance)
# y for orchestra
# y for web-ui
# n for haproxy
# y for all storages useful
# orchestra, wait for finish install (use htop or 'sudo juju status' wait pending)
# when finished restart script, say no to all and yes to orchestra
# copy by hand config.py in /var/lib/juju to /var/www/api on orchestra (look at error.log of wcgi flask)
# config user in user.csv in OSCIED/scenarios/local

todo:
 * easy deploy
 * easy specific reploy (one charm)






# custom script of OSCIED call juju inside but we could simply and deploy ourself each charms
