CodecWatch Graphs requirements, first version:
- Build an interface similar to http://areweslimyet.com for displaying video
  quality measurements, probably using the same library: http://www.flotcharts.org/
- Graph should have bitrate (in kb/s) on the x-axis and quality (in decibels) on the y-axis.
- The input format could be something like this:
var input = [
    {
        "encoder": "x264",
        "sample": "fileA.mp4",
        "datetime": "2014-04-04T12:42:01Z", (iso 8601)
        "type": "PSNR",
		"rate": "8001.3232"
        "value": "46.45232",
        "gitrev": "bd62cf0690a426744cebc376ba7917988245366c"
     },
     // ...
];
- Using input elements, the user can choose which file, which encoder, etc will be used for comparisons
- Initially, we will support two types of graphs:
  * Graphs where the datetime is fixed and there's a line for each different encoder.
  * Graphs where the encoder is fixed and there's a line for each datetime.
- When clicking on a point in the graph, the following informations should be displayed:
  * Encoder used
  * Exact quality in dB
  * Git revision of the encoder used, with a link to the git commit message
  * Date corresponding to the git revision
